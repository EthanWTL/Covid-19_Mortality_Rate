# Decentralized Machine Learning Approach on ICU Admission Prediction for Enhanced Patient Care Using COVID-19 Data
## Description

Welcome! ðŸ˜€

This work focused on the COVID-19 dataset provided by [this source](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico) provided by Mexico Government.

We managed to determine who would need more medical treatment among the hospitalized patients before they ended up in the ICU, by using who eventually went to the ICU or died as the classification criteria and other diseases and body condition as features.

## Stage 0: Data Exploration and Data Preprocessing

## Stage I: Baseline Modeling

To create a baseline understanding of the project as well as testing our data cleaning accuracy, we delpoyed a set of traditional machine learning technique, the results for Cleveland datasets are shown as following.

| ML Technique  | Acc | Recall |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Decision Tree  | 70.86% | 55.17% |
| Random Forest  | 72.77%|  58.99% |
| SVM | 74.72% |  45.39% |
| Bayesian Classifier  | 71.69% | 66.82%  |
| SOM | 61.38% | 19.48% |
| DNN | 76.22% | 58.61%  | 
| CNN | 76.01% | 54.26% | 
| RNN | 74.80% |  44.43%| 




## Stage II: Federated Learning
### Getting started with FL
* Download the [MNIST data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scolianni/mnistasjpg)
* Run the Python files
  ```sh
   python FL_demo/run_federated_learning.py
   ```
* Global Model Accuracy: ```80.20%```
* Check out [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) with more detailed explanation about FL.

### Our FL pipeline:
```mermaid
graph TB
    A{Global Model} <-- weights_transfer --> B[Model_1]
    A{Global Model} <-- weights_transfer --> C[Model_2]
    A{Global Model} <-- weights_transfer --> D[Model_3]
    A{Global Model} <-- weights_transfer --> E[Model_4]

    B -- training --> F((DataShard_1))
    C -- training --> G((DataShard_2))
    D -- training --> H((DataShard_3))
    E -- training --> I((DataShard_4))

    F -- update_model --> J(Model_1_updated)
    G -- update_model --> K(Model_2_updated)
    H -- update_model --> L(Model_3_updated)
    I -- update_model --> M(Model_4_updated)

```
### Results:
* ```Learning rate```: 0.01
* ```Optimizer```: SGD
* ```Loss function```: Sparse Cross Entropy
* Result after 100 ```global epochs```:

  |Model Accuracy| Centralized  | Shard1 | Shard2 | Shard3 | Shard4 |
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  |CNN-FL|73.20%|73.29%|73.75%|73.08%|72.69%|
  |DNN-FL|75.59%|75.54%|75.96%|75.67%|75.20%|
  |RNN-FL|75.81%|75.83%|76.32%|75.82%|75.25%|

  |Recall On ICU| Centralized | Shard1 | Shard2 | Shard3 | Shard4 |
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  |DNN-FL|57.15%|75.31%|75.09%|75.85%|75.43%|
  |CNN-FL|69.70%|65.55%|65.33%|65.00%|64.90%|
  |RNN-FL|58.73%|75.18%|74.74%|75.23%|74.47%|
